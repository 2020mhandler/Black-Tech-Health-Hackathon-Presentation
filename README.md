# ML Project
## Black Tech Health Hackathon Co-sponsored by Johnson & Johnson and Amazon
- Developed a predictive analysis model with Amazon Sagemaker to address health disparities and inequalities by race and ethnicity.
- Used big datasets to predict reasons for infant death in white and black communities; model performed with a 91% accuracy rate
  - Proposed that this model can be used in hospitals and be made into a mobile app to help mothers anticipating pregnancy
- Awarded 1st Prize at Johnson & Johnson Hackathon; Technologies used: Amazon Sagemaker, AWS, QuickSight
- This experience served as intro to data science and machine learning for me, and I am working to expanding the model
